# Pokemon ROM Editor

This is a rewrite of my original Pokemon ROM editor [link here](https://github.com/jakefordyce/PokemonROMEditor)

***This program is not yet functional!***

I hope to have it partially working soon but for now I'm just storing my code here so I don't lose it.



I got tons of my info from:
